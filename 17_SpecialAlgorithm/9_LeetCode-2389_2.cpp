#   LeetCode-2389 :- Longest Subsequence with Limited sum.
    You are given an integer array nums of length n, and an integer array queries of length m.

    Return an array answer of length m where answer[i] is the maximum size of a subsequence that you can take from nums such that the sum of its elements is less than or equal to queries[i].

    A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [4,5,2,1], queries = [3,10,21]
    Output: [2,3,4]
    Explanation: We answer the queries as follows:
    - The subsequence [2,1] has a sum less than or equal to 3. It can be proven that 2 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[0] = 2.
    - The subsequence [4,5,1] has a sum less than or equal to 10. It can be proven that 3 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[1] = 3.
    - The subsequence [4,5,2,1] has a sum less than or equal to 21. It can be proven that 4 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[2] = 4.

    Example 2:
    Input: nums = [2,3,4,5], queries = [1]
    Output: [0]
    Explanation: The empty subsequence is the only subsequence that has a sum less than or equal to 1, so answer[0] = 0.
